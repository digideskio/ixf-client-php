# IXF Database - PHP Client

PHP RESTful interface for the IXF database,




## Source / Origin Story

[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) created  a beautiful [API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/php)
for the payment gateway. They open sourced the PHP library under the MIT license. This
library is based on that.

*(a few hours later)* Hmmmm... beautiful API interface, horrendously coded API
library. It was a mistake to use it but that's a bed I've made for myself now.
I've stripped 50% of the code and it's still horrible. But, if you're using
the client, what lies beneath is irrelevant. I must still recode / fix it
though.
